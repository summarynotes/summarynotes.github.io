> Not a designer. You can contribute if you want. Will update this readme with time.

## Creating notes:

- Almost all notes and tests were created using markdown. For maths, I have use latex.

- Extension used to convert md to pdf:

```markdown
Name: Markdown PDF
Id: yzane.markdown-pdf
Description: Convert Markdown to PDF
Version: 1.5.0
Publisher: yzane
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf
```

- It doesn't support LaTex by default so use this libary:
```js
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
</script>
```
