## Networking devices:

- Hub: Connects devices and forwards data from one port to every port.
- Switch: Connects devices and forwards data from one port to another specific port.
- Router: Directs data between networks.
- Gateway: Connects networks with different protocol.
- Bridge: Connects networks-segments with same protocol.
- Network Interface Card(NIC): Available on end-sytem. Has ports for LAN.
- Repeater: Receives signal and generates a new full-strength signal.
- Wireless Access Point(WAP): Central Device in WiFi LAN. Needs WNIC.

## Network based on size

- LAN(Local area network): Small, owned by an organization or company within a site or branch, single switch/hub. Eg. Office network.
- MAN(Metropolitan area network): Larger, over longer distance. Eg. Traffic control CCTV network.
- WAN: Large organization, spread over large distance. Eg. Internet.

> There isn't a fixed rule for LAN, MAN and WAN.

## Network Architecture/Model

- Client-Server Model: Some computers provide service(servers) and some request and use features(clients).
    - Thin client: Client just takes input and shows output. Server runs application.
    - Thick client: Clieent can do some processing but relies on server for *heavy* work. 

> Another type is peer to peer where each computer has equal responsibility. (Discussed in paper 3.)

- Peer to peer model is oftten used for file sharing where each peer(computer) can send and receive file from each-other. But if security and control is of main priority, client-server is used.

> Server can be: File server, DNS server, etc.

## Transmision modes:

- Simplex: One way data transfer
- Half-duplex: Both way but not simultaneously
- Full-duplex: Both way simultaneously


- Unicast: One-to-one communication
- Multicast: One-to-many communication
- Broadcast: One-to-all communication

## Network Topologies

> Network topology is the layout of computers in LAN.

- Bus topology: A central link(bus) with several drop lines to connect to end-systems.
    - Advantages:
        - Simple to setup
        - Simple to add nodes
    - Disadvantages:
        - If the central link fails, network fails. (But not if one drop line fails or node fails)
        - Broadcast

- Mesh topology: Each pair of computer is connected.
    - Advantages:
        - Fast
        - No single point of failure.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Lots of wires

- Star topology: Each end-system is connected to a central hub or switch(mostly switch).
    - Advantages:
        - Adding and removing nodes is easy
        - Central device can be used to connect to internet(or other network).
    - Disadvantages:
        - Single point of failure

- Ring topology: Connected in a ring, data flows in one direction(clockwise or anti-clockwise)
    - Not used as it has single point of failure, privacy issue, need to disrupt network to add device.

> bus, star, ring, mesh toopologies are shown in image above

> Hybrid topology is also used.

## Transmission media

- Wired:
    - Twisted pair (RJ-45 connector)
    - Co-axial (BNC connector)
    - Fibre-optics (SC connector)
![cables](../img/cables.png)

- Wireless:
    - Radio
    - Microwave
    - Infrared
![wireless](../img/wireless.png)

> Radio, microwave and infrared are all electromagnetic radiation with different frequency. Higher frequency => lower penetrative power.

- Wired for faster, reliable, less interference.
- Wireless for ease of use(mostly).

- Satellite: 
    - Geostationary Earth Orbit: For long distance telephone and network communication.(3 for global coverage)
    - Medium Earth Orbit: GPS.(10 for global coverage)
    - Lower Earth Orbit: Supplement mobile phone networks. (50 for full global coverage) 
![satellite](../img/satellite.png)

> Van allen belts are areas in atmosphere with high levels of electrically charged particles, which interfere with satellite.

## Ethernet and Collision.

> Ethernet is wired standard(IEEE 802.3) which is primarily focused on LANs.

- Shared medium => if two end-system transmit at once, it can result in *collision*.

- CSMA/CD(Collision Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):
    - Check voltage on medium for activity
    - If activity, wait for random time.
    - If no activity, start transmission
    - Continuously check for collision
    - If not detected, continue sending and done.
    - If detected, stop, transmit jamming signal(high voltage) and try again aftter random time.

> Modern Ethernet is switched with buffering capacity, which doesn't require CSMA/CD.

## IP Addressing:

> Internet Protocol adressing is used to define from where and to where data is being transmitted.

- IPv4 addressing:
    - uses 32 bits => 2<sup>32</sup> different addresses.
    - Not enough.
    - In original scheme, different classes existed with different number of IPs.
    - CIDR(Classless interdomain routing) retains concept of netID and hostId but doesn't inforce number of bits like in classful approach.
    - Subnetting allows for organization to take a larger class and split it into smaller parts.
    - Network Address Translation(NAT): Organizations use special IPs for private netwrok and NAT box translates it. This is abstracted.

![ip_class](../img/ip_class.png)
> Dynamic IP changes regularly for device whereas Static doesn't. (and static is costly.)

- IPv6:
    - 128 bits is used
    - Will not be depleted.
    - Still not being used everywhere.

## Domain Names

> People can remember words and letters(URL), IP addresses are numbers. Domain Name Service/System(DNS) server translates that.

- DNS is also hierarchical.
- Looking up IP based on domain name is called *name resolution*.

## Terms:

- ISP: Internet Service Provider. Provides internet connection.
- PSTN: Public Switched telephone network. *Dial-up* connection that used telephone wire and modem.
- WWW: World wide web. Distributed application which is available on the internet.
- Cloud computing: Accessing computing service via internet. *Private cloud* is established by a company by either taking full responsibility, outtsourcing partially or fully. *Public* cloud is created, managed and owned by third party service provider.
    - Cloud computing services include infrastructure, platform or software.
- Bit streaming: 
    - On demand: Incoming data are buffered and received as they are *used*
    - Real time: live transmission
