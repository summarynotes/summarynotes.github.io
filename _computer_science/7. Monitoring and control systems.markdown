<u><b>Chapter 7: Monitoring and Control systems</b></u>

> Monitoring system detects change in physical property of system or environment.

> Control systems have monitoring + capacity to control a system.

- Sensor is device used for monitoring and actuator is device connected to controlling device.

> An open loop system doesn't pay attention to actual output whereas a closed-loop system is one where the feedback is taken from actual output and that controls the operation.
