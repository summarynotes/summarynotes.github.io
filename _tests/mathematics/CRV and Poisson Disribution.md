Full marks: 32
<hr>

## 1. The random variable X is a continuous random variable with probability density function

![pdf1](../img/pdf1.png)

i) find the value of k. (2)<br>
ii) Sketch the probability density function.(3)<br>
iii) find P(1<X<=1.5). (3) <br>

## 2. Jess is watching a shower of meteors(shooting stars). During the shower, she sees meteors at an average rate of 1.3 per minute.

i) State conditions requried for a Poisson distribution to be a suitable model for the number of meteors which Jess sees during a randomly selected minute.(2)<br>

You may assume that these conditions are satisfied.<br>
ii) Find the probability that, during one minute, Jess sees:(4)<br>
a) exactly one meteor
b) at least 4 meteors.

iii) Find the probability that, in a period of 10 minutes, Jess sees 10 meteors.(3) <br>
iv) Use suitable approximating distribution ot find the probability that Jess sees a total of at least 100 meteors during a period of one hour.(5) <br>
v) Jess watches the shower for t minutes. She wishes to be at least 99% certain that she will see one or more meteors. Find the smallest possible integer value of t. (5) <br>
