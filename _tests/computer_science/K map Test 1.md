## Karnaugh Map - Test 1

#### 1) Obtain optimized SOP for following truth table using K-Map:

a) 3 variable

b) 4 variable

#### 2) Simplify the following boolean expression using K-Map:

a) A'BC + ABC' <- Try to make overlapping loops

b) 0 2 11 8 1 3 <- Corner and a line, 4 variables

#### 3) The following logic circuits contain some redundancy. Use K-Map to get simplified SOP and draw logic circuit of the simplified expression:
