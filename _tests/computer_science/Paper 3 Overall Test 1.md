## Paper 3 Overall Theory Test 1

- Full marks: 40

1) Temperature data from a number of weather stations are to be processed.
The following data are to be stored:
    - weather station ID(a unique four-letter code)
    - latitude (to 2 decimal places)
    - average temperature(to the nearest whole number) for each year from 2001 to 2015 inclusive

- A programmer designs a composite data type WeatherStation. A variable of this type can be used to store all the data for one particular station.
    - (i) Write the definition for the user-defined data type **WeatherStation**. [5]<br>
    - (ii) The programmer decides to store all the data in a file. The number of weather stations could grow to reach 200000, but not all stations will be present at first. The programmer decides on random file organization for the file. Describe **three** steps which show how a new weather station record is added to the file. [3]

2) In a particular number system, real numbers are stored using floating pointt representation using:
    - 8 bits for mantissa <br>
    - 8 bits for exponent <br>
Two's complement form is used for both mantissa and exponent.

- (i) A real number is stored as the following two bytes:
    - Mantissa: 00101000 
    - Exponent: 00000011 <br>
Calculate the denary value of this number. Show working. [3]

- (ii) Explain why the floating point number is not normalized. [2]<br>
- (iii) Normalize the floating-point number. [2]<br>
- (iv) Write the largest positive number that can be written as a normalized number in this format. [2]<br>

3) In packet switching:

- (i) State **two items** that are contained in an email packet apart from the data. [2]
- (ii) Explain the role of routers in packet switching. [3]

4)  For the logic circuit with following truth table:
![truth_table_1](../img/tt1.png)

- (i) Construct K-map. [4] <br>
- (ii) Draw loops around appropriate groups of 1's to produce an optimal sum-of-products. [2] <br>
- (iii) Write the simplied sum-of-products Boolean function using the grouping in part (ii). [2] <br>

---

5) The following syntax diagrams are for a particular programming language:
![Syntax1](../img/syntax1.png)

- (i) State with reason if the following statements are valid: [3]
    - a = b+c
    - a = b-2;
    - a = dd*cce;
- (ii) Write the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) for the syntax diagrams shown above. [6]
- (iii) Programmers working for the software company prefer to debug their programs using an interprete. Give **one** possible reason why. [1]
