# Pure maths 3

## Algebra:
- Modulus function
    - graph : graph of line => reflect anything below x axis
    - Solve
        - equation: solve and check answers
            - both side inequality: squaring both side
            - one side inequality: Take +ve and negative
        - inequality
            - Graph or +ve/-ve
- Polynomial
    - Division
    - Remainder theorem: f(x) / (x-a) => Remainder = f(a)
    - Factore theorem: if f(a) = 0 => x-a is a factor
    - Factorize:
        - Substitute different values until you get f(a) = 0, x-a is factor => divide (Calculator: table)

## Logarithmic and exponential function:
- Graph of e<sup>x</sup>, lnx and shifting
- Equations : take log on both side and simplify
- Converting to linear : take log on both side => y=mx+c, new variables

## Differentiation:
- Product rule, Quotient rule
- Parametric/implicit : chain rule
    - find dy/dx if x<sup>2</sup> + 3xy + 2y<sup>2</sup> = 10
    - if x = 3 - t<sup>3</sup>, y = t<sup>2</sup> - 2t, find dy/dx 

## Integration:

- ax+b instead of x : divide by derivative of ax+b i.e. a
    - Differentiate: e<sup>5x+6</sup>, 1/(ax+b), sin(ax+b)...

## Numerical solution of equations:
- Bisection method
    - proving that there is a solution between the given range of values
    - Finding approx. root*(rarely asked)
- Iterative formula


## Further algebra:
- Partial fraction
- expansion of (1+x)<sup>n</sup>, where |x| < 1

## Further calculus:
- tan<sup>-1</sup>(x/a)
- derivative of num/den on numerator
- partial fraction
- Substitution (use substition, and replace dx)
- Integration by part : DI method

## Vectors:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication by scalar
- magnitude, direction
- Scalar product (dot product)
- Vector equation of line
    - find
    - prove parallel, perpendicular
    - intersection

## Differential equations:
- Create differential equation
- Variable separable
    - general solution(with c)
    - particular solution(without c)

## Complex number:
- Simplification
- Solve quadratic(quadratic formula)
- find r and theta
- square root
- Argand diagram
