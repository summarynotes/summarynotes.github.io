<u><b>Chapter 5: Processor fundamentals</b></u>

## Von-Neuman model of computer system

- There is memory to store program which consist of several instructions. Processor has direct access to memory and executes instruction sequentially.

## CPU Architecture.

- Components:
    - PC: Program Counter. Holds address of next instruction.
    - MAR: Memory Address Register.  Holds memory location to read from.
    - MDR/MBR: Memory Data/Buffer Register. Holds data after just reading or when about to write.
    - IX: Index register. Used in indexed addressing.
    - CIR: Current Instruction Register.
    - SR: Status register. Contains bits/flags that change during processing and can be accessed individually.

- System bus:
    - Data bus carries data(instruction, address or value). Bidirectional.
    - Address bus carries an address. One way to memory controller or I/O controller.
    - Control bus: Carries control signal. Bidirectional.

## System Performance

- Dictated by:
    - Processor clock speed
    - Word length: Number of bits that can be handled as one unit. Choice of word length also impacts bus widths and register size.
    - Cache size
    - Number of cores(processors).

## I/O ports:

- USB:
    - Serial standard
    - It is a bus.
    - Can handle 127 devices
    - Several versions.
    - Plug-and-play.

- VGA: Video graphics array. Doesn't transmit audio component.
- HDMI: High quality audio+video.

## Fetch-Execute Cycle:

```markdown
MAR <- [PC] //Content of PC to MAR
PC <- [PC]+1; MDR <- [[MAR]] //PC incremented and Content of address pointed by MAR is transferred to MDR. Simultaneously.
CIR <- [MDR] // Content of MDR to CIR
```

## Interrupt handling

> Interrups are signals(mostly important ones).

- Interrupts are detected at end of F-E cycle.
- Content of PC and registers are saved
- Interrupt handler or ISR is initialized by loading address into PC.
- When done, check if more.
- If no further interrupt, restore saved contents of registers and continue.
