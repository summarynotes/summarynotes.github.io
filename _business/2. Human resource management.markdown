# Human resource management

> Human resource management(HRM) comprises the acquisition, training, motivation and reward of human resources within the business.

- Human resource management is the process of making the most efficient use of the organization's employees.

## Purpose and role of human resource management.

> The main purpose of HRM is to achieve organisational objectives, such as growth and increased profitability by enhancing organisational performance.

- All elements of HRM, if implemented fully and operated properly, fulfill the needs of individual as well as of the organisation.
- Outcome of a sucessful HRM policy could be motivated and creative employees who are committed to the firm and who do not seek to leave. Under such sitution, a business should incur lower recruitment costs and enjoy higher level of productivity and a reduction in faulty products. 
- Businesses differ in their interpretation of HRM. Some see it as a confirmation of value of employees while others view employees as simply  another resourcee to be used as effectively as possible.

- Two key reasons exist to highlight the importance of HRM within business:
    - Nature of workforce has changed and greater use of part-time and peripheral workers is seen currently.
    - Changes in organisational structure and use of techniques such as delayering and development of empowered teams. Delayering is reduction in the number of levels of hierarchy within an organisational structure.

## Workforce planning

- A workforce plan (human resource plan) means assessing the current workforce and actions necessary to meet the business' future labour needs.

- Role of workforce plan:
    - They help businesss to deal with changes by ensuring they have right employees.
    - They help businesses to prepare for changes in workforce such as introduction to new production-line machinery.

- Workforce plans are designed to take proactive monitoring and not simply a reactive one.


## Labour turnover

- Turnover is measure of proportion of a workforce leaving their employment. It is calculated as percentage of a business' workforce that leaves a business over a given period of time. 

- The formula for turnover is given by:

![turnover](../img/turnover.png)
<!-- $$
\text{Turnover} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of staff leaving during the year}}{\text{Average number of staff}} \right) \times 100
$$ -->


- Some level of turnover is inevitable. This has positive effect of being able to recruit employees to bring new ideas into a business.
- High level of labour turnover results in additional costs to recruit and train new employees. A business might need to increase pay in order to reduce the level of labour turnover.
- A business also suffers if labour turnover is too low. For example: in creative industries such as marketing, it is often helpful for business to have a stable and steady rate of turnover.

## Recruitment and selection

> Recruitment and selection is the process of filling in organization's job vacancies by appointing new staff.

    -Good relation between manager and employees
    -high level of labour productivity

## Motivation theories:

- Motivation theories can be classified into two perspectives:
 - Content theories
 - Process theories

## Content theories:

> It consider what motivates people. The content theories can be divided into three schools of though.

### Scientific school

**Key Ideas:**
- Motivation is an external factor achieved through money.
- Employees should be closely supervised and paid piece rate.

**Taylorism:**
- Study the work process to determine the most efficient production method.
- Observe and time the best workers in these methods.
- Train the remaining workers to the same standard.
- Implement differential pay rates and close supervision to increase productivity.

Taylors approach reduced inefficiency and productivity so business did not need as many employees. His ideas resulted in strikes and other forms of industrial action by dissatisfied workers.

### Human relation school:
**Key Idea:**
- This brought sociological theory into management and accepted that employees could be motivated by meeting their social needs.

- Hawthorne effect:
    - it is based on research conducted at western electric companies harthrone plant .
    - it showed that employees were responding to the level of attention they were receiving as part of the investigation and working as a group

### Neo-Human relation school:

**Key idea:**
- it highlighted the importance of fulfilling phycological needs to improve employe performance

#### Maslow's hierarchy of needs:
- The hierarchy of needs is a theory that employees have successive requirements that can be fulfilled through work:
  - Physiological needs: food, water, shelter, and clothing.
  - Security needs: safe and secure working environment.
  - Social needs: contact and friendship with other employees.
  - Esteem needs: achievement, recognition, and self-respect.
  - Self-actualization: to fulfill one's potential completely.

#### Frederick Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:
- This was the result of a study designed to test the view that people face two major sets of influences at work.

- Hygiene or Maintenance Factors: Related to the environment of work
  - Company policy and administration
  - Supervision of employees
  - Working conditions
  - Salary
  - Relationship with fellow workers

- Motivators: Related to the job itself and can be used to motivate
  - Personal achievement of goals and targets
  - Recognition of achievement
  - Interest in work itself
  - Responsibility for greater and more complex duties
  - Personal growth and advancement

> Herzberg's crucial finding was that hygiene factors do no lead to motivation but without them employees may be dissatisfied.

#### David McClelland's Theory of Needs:
- Argued that an individual's motivation depends upon their needs, which are determined by their experiences.
- Identified three types of motivational needs:
  - Achievement motivation
  - Authority/power motivation
  - Affiliation motivation

## Process theories

> examine the process of motivation and are concerned with ‘how’ motivation occurs.

### Victor Vroom's expectancy theory.

> Vroom argues that motivation depends on empoloyees' expectations of the result of their efforts.

Vroom’s model consists of three major elements:

- Expeectancy: Confidence that employees may have in their ability to complete a particular task
    Expectancy leads to better performance.
- Instrumentality: Belief that completion of a particular task will lead to desired outcome.
    Intrumentality leads to outcome/reward.
- Valence: Strength of a person's desire to achieve a specific outcome. It refers to personal objectives.

## Motivation methods in practice

### Financial motivators

- Taylor saw pay as the primary motivating factor for all workers and supporteed the use of piece rate
- Maslow saw pay as a reward which permitted employees to meet the lower needs on their hierarchy
- Herzberg saw pay as a hygiene factor and a possible cause of dissatisfaction

- **Time based pay**: Payments based on the number of hours worked. Simple but may lead employees becoming clock-watchers.
- **Salary and wages**: Salaried workers are not normally required to work a set number of hours, though their contract may state a minimum of number of hours.
    - Salaries: expressed in annual terms and paid monthly
    - Wages: usually paid weekly and workers are required to be at work for a specified number of hours. They are paid a higher rate for overtime.
- **Piece-rate**: Employees are paid according to the quantity they produce. It may lead to increased productivity but may cause decrease in quality.
- **Bonuses and commission**: Bonuses are additions to pay linked to individual or team peerformancee measured against target. Commission is the payment for the quantity that is produced by an individual employee.
- **Profit sharing**: It is a reward system under which employees receive some part of the business' profits. Profits are paid to employees in thee form of cash or company shares.
- **Performance related pay(PRP)**:  Under PRP, employees are paid for their contribution to the organization, rather than their status within it. The problem with PRP is performance is often difficult to measure, feeling of dicrimination, and businessees not putting sufficient funds.
- **Variable pay**: It is a more flexible schemee where potential rewards for star employees are greater.
- **Fringe benefits**: Extras that employees receive as part of their reward package. Sometimes referred to as perks.

### Non-financial motivators

- **Job redesign**: 
    - Job enrichment occurs when employees' jobs are redesined to provide then with more challenging and complex tasks, which is also called vertical loading. Job enlargement, also called horizonal loading, increases number of similar task instead of increasing complexity of task.
- **Employee empowerment** : providing greater control over their work life.
- **Teamworking**: Breaking producttion into large units insted of relying on division of labour.
- **Training and development**
- **Employee participation**: Involvement of employees in process of decision making. It can be done in form of quality circles, work councils, employee shareholders, and autonomous work groups.
- **Promotion and status**
