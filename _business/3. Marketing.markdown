# The nature of marketing

> Marketing is the process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying the needs of customers in a mutually beneficial exchange process.

- Marketing is:
    - exchange process: business offers goods and usually gets payment in return.
    - mutually beneficial
    - aims to identify and anticipate customer needs.
    - aims to delight customers

## Importance of marketing

- Marketing is ongoing process since business is dynamic and customers' needs change over time.

- Effective marketing will increase customer satisfaction, which means the customers:
    - are more likely to come back
    - are more likely to recommend
    - may be more willing to try new products by the business
    - may become loyal to product and less likely to switch

- Marketing objectives:
    - Sales targets
    - Market share
    - Brand awareness

> Marketing objectives will be linked to the overall objectives of the business. An objective should be quantifiable and include a time element.

- Marketing will discuss and negotiate with operations, finance and human resource departments. By doing this, it influencees what is produced, how many are produced, the range of products offered, and the price at which products are sold.

## Demand and supply

> Demand refers to how much customers are willing and able to buy at a given price in a given period of time. Supply is the quantity of a particular product that firms are willing and able to sell at a given price in a given period of time.

- A supply curve shows supply at each and every price and demand curve shows demand at every price with all other factors unchanged.

- Supply will depend on:
    - The number of firms producing
    - The time period
    - Technology
    - Costs (including effect of government subsidies, taxes)

- Demand will depend no:
    - Income of buyers
    - The price of rivals' products
    - The price of complementary products
    - marketing activities

- If quantity demanded and supplied is equal and there is no incentive to change, this is known as market equilibrium and the corresponding price and quantity are called equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.

### Effect of change in demand and supply on equilibrium

- Change in price leads to movement along curves and change in conditions will lead to shift in curve.

- If demand conditions change and there is a decrease, the quantity demanded at each prive will shift demand inwards. At the old price, there is now excess supply and this leads to fall in the price. As the price decreases, this decreases the quantity businesses will supply and increases the quantity demanded until a new equilibrium is reached.

- Effect of decrease in demand:

## Markets

### Consumer and industrial markets

- In customer markets, the customer buys the product and it is consumed.
- If a business is selling products directly to the customers who will consume them, this will involve business-to-customer marketing(B2C).

- When you are seelling products to be used in the production proceess for other products, this is known as producer or industrial market. When one business is marketing its products to another business to buy, this is known as business-to-business marketing(B2B).
